    <p>
      My name is Hironao Yamato, I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukui_Prefectural_Fujishima_High_School">Fukui Prefectual Fujishima High School</a> (, which the legendary physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu">Dr. Yoichiro Nanbu</a> went to) and am currently studying Physics at <a href="https://www.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/"> Department of Physics, School of Science, Osaka University</a>.

      My major vices are  movies, music and camping. Here, I mean a real camping, not the ridiculous shit with too many expensive geers. Don't confuse me with the idoits who can't survive in the wild. If you want to come to our side, try read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Bear-Grylls/dp/1905026374"><i>"Born Survivor"</i></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB%E7%99%BB%E5%B1%B1%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-%E6%9C%8D%E9%83%A8%E6%96%87%E7%A5%A5/dp/4906905099/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&crid=2XCIEKOQM07XX&keywords=%E3%82%B5%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB%E7%99%BB%E5%B1%B1%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80&qid=1696503862&s=english-books&sprefix=%E3%82%B5%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB%E7%99%BB%E5%B1%B1%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80%2Cenglish-books%2C154&sr=1-1"><small><i>"サバイバル登山入門"</i></small></a>. Also I want to try hunting someday.

      I like free softwares. I run Ubuntu on all of my computers. I like its noob-friendliness. On Ubuntu, I mainly use Bash from GNOME Terminal, GNU Emacs, Firefox and Chrome. I run Emacs inside Terminal, so that I don't have to worry about moving the mouse and moving the cursor which would be nuisance.
