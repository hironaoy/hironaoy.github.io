    <h1>Hironao Yamato</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Hironao Yamato, I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukui_Prefectural_Fujishima_High_School">Fukui Prefectual Fujishima High School</a> (, which the legendary physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu">Dr. Yoichiro Nanbu</a> went to) and am currently studying Physics at <a href="https://www.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/"> Department of Physics, School of Science, Osaka University</a>.

      My major vices are <a href="movies.html">movies</a>, music, and camping. I do not camp with a lot of expensive gears. Some poeple enjoy camping with half their apartment, but it wasn''t a case with me. Recently I have been trying to camp with as little stuff as possible. It may well be able to be called survival, rather than camping.

      I like free softwares. I run Ubuntu on all of my computers. I like its noob-friendliness. On Ubuntu, I mainly use Bash from GNOME Terminal, GNU Emacs, Firefox and Chrome. I run Emacs inside Terminal, so that I don't have to worry about touching the mouse and moving the cursor which would be nuisance.
